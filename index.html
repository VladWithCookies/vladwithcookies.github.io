        Summary
      </h2>
      <p>
        In love with web development for over 13 years. My main expertise is frontend development but I have ample experience in backend
        as well. My main goal is to achieve both outer (smooth, careful and accessible UI) and inner beauty of the product (code quality,
        performance, security and clockwork business logic). So far I have over 17 big scale projects in my portfolio across different
        business domains (E-commerce, Fin-Tech, Ad-Tech, Healthcare, Real Estate etc). Besides this I have experience as a Lead Engineer
        and Head of Frontend Department. In addition, I was a mentor for over 30 developers and had experience as tech writer and speaker
        on various tech meetups.
